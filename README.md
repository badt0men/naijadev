This is a simple project I am building in the process of learning how to use the JAMSTACk.  
[`ngDevHub`] a place where you source the most intelligent and smart developers in Nigeria. Recommended, Vetted, and Trusted. There's never any doubt on the competence of all the devs in our community. 
A fun project I would love to see till the end.
